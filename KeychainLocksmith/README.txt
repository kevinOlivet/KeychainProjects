#KeychainLocksmith

This project uses implements Keychain using the Locksmith 3rd party framework.
The Locksmith GitHub can be found here: 
https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Locksmith

The framework was added using CocoaPods.

The project implements save, retrieve, update and delete using mock data.
The mock data and status is displayed in labels in the view.

I like this project as it saves a dictionary to a userAccount and not just a String, Double or Bool.
But using a 3rd party framework adds risk for a Keychain project.
