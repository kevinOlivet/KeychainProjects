#SwiftKeychainWrapperTest

This project implements Keychain to set, retrieve and delete passwords to/from Keychain.
It uses the wrapper files KeychainAccesiblity.swift and KeychainWrapper.swift taken from here:
https://github.com/jrendel/SwiftKeychainWrapper

The instructions say to install the framework using CocoaPods but really you only need those two files.
Save a little memory overhead when possible :)
